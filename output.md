Markdown Content:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Rust

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## A language empowering everyone   to build reliable and efficient software.
[Get Started](/learn/get-started)Version 1.83.0


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why Rust?

### Performance
Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no runtime or
garbage collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on
embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages.


### Reliability
Rust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety
and thread-safety — enabling you to eliminate many classes of
bugs at compile-time.


### Productivity
Rust has great documentation, a friendly compiler with useful error
messages, and top-notch tooling — an integrated package manager
and build tool, smart multi-editor support with auto-completion and
type inspections, an auto-formatter, and more.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Build it in Rust
In 2018, the Rust community decided to improve the programming experience
for a few distinct domains (see  the 2018
roadmap ). For these, you can find many high-quality crates and some
awesome guides on how to get started.

### Command Line
Whip up a CLI tool quickly with Rust’s robust ecosystem.
Rust helps you maintain your app with confidence and distribute it with ease.

### WebAssembly
Use Rust to supercharge your JavaScript, one module at a time.
Publish to npm, bundle with webpack, and you’re off to the races.

### Networking
Predictable performance. Tiny resource footprint. Rock-solid reliability.
Rust is great for network services.

### Embedded
Targeting low-resource devices?
Need low-level control without giving up high-level conveniences?
Rust has you covered.

## Rust in production
Hundreds of companies around the world are using Rust in production
today for fast, low-resource, cross-platform solutions. Software you know
and love, like  Firefox ,
 Dropbox ,
and  Cloudflare ,
uses Rust.  From startups to large
corporations, from embedded devices to scalable web services, Rust is a great fit.
